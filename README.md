# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in software development where stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process helps ensure that the final product meets the intended purpose and reduces the risk of costly changes later in the project lifecycle. Effective requirement analysis involves clear communication, thorough documentation, and validation of requirements with all stakeholders.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with business objectives and user needs.

During requirement analysis, analysts work closely with stakeholders—including clients, end-users, and project managers—to elicit both functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements are then documented, analyzed for feasibility, prioritized, and validated to ensure clarity and completeness.

The importance of requirement analysis in the SDLC includes:

- **Clarity and Alignment:** It helps bridge the gap between stakeholders and developers, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project goals.
- **Risk Reduction:** By identifying potential issues and ambiguities early, requirement analysis minimizes the risk of costly changes and rework later in the project.
- **Scope Management:** Clearly defined requirements help prevent scope creep and keep the project on track.
- **Quality Assurance:** Well-documented requirements serve as a baseline for testing and validation, ensuring the delivered software meets user expectations.
- **Resource Optimization:** Accurate requirements enable better estimation of time, cost, and resources needed for the project.

In summary, requirement analysis is essential for delivering successful software projects that meet stakeholder needs, stay within budget, and are completed on time.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis is a foundational activity in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for several reasons:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication:** By thoroughly documenting and validating requirements, teams ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and conflicting expectations.

2. **Reduces Project Risks:** Early identification and clarification of requirements help uncover potential issues, ambiguities, or gaps. Addressing these risks at the outset minimizes costly changes, delays, and rework during later stages of development.

3. **Enables Effective Planning:** Clear and detailed requirements provide a solid basis for accurate project estimation, resource allocation, and scheduling. This leads to better project management and increases the likelihood of delivering the software on time and within budget.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis process involves several key activities to ensure comprehensive and accurate requirements:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
   Collect information from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints for the software system.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
   Use techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to draw out detailed requirements from stakeholders, clarifying ambiguities and uncovering hidden needs.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
   Record the gathered and elicited requirements in a clear, structured, and accessible format. This documentation serves as a reference for all project participants and helps maintain alignment throughout the development process.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
   Examine and refine the documented requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, feasible, and unambiguous. Use models, diagrams, and prototypes to visualize requirements and explore different solutions.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
   Review and confirm requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with business objectives. Validation helps detect errors or misunderstandings before development begins.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements specify what the system should do—its features, behaviors, and functions. They describe the interactions between the system and its users or other systems.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**

- Users can create, view, update, and cancel bookings for available resources (e.g., meeting rooms, equipment).
- The system sends confirmation emails to users after a booking is made or modified.
- Administrators can manage user accounts and view all booking records.
- The system prevents double-booking of the same resource for overlapping time slots.
- Users can search for available resources based on date, time, and resource type.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes, constraints, and standards the system must meet. They focus on how the system performs its functions rather than what it does.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**

- The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Booking confirmation emails should be delivered within 1 minute of the booking action.
- The application should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest to ensure security.
- The system should have 99.9% uptime, excluding scheduled maintenance.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They help illustrate the functional requirements of a system by showing the various ways users interact with it. Use Case Diagrams are beneficial because they:

- Provide a high-level overview of system functionality.
- Clarify user roles and their interactions with the system.
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders, developers, and designers.
- Help identify and organize system requirements.

### Use Case Diagram for the Booking Management System

Below is a use case diagram for the booking management system. The diagram identifies the main actors and their interactions with the system:

**Actors:**

- User
- Administrator

**Use Cases:**

- Create Booking
- View Booking
- Update Booking
- Cancel Booking
- Search Resources
- Receive Confirmation Email
- Manage User Accounts (Administrator)
- View All Bookings (Administrator)
