# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in software development where stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process helps ensure that the final product meets the intended purpose and reduces the risk of costly changes later in the project lifecycle. Effective requirement analysis involves clear communication, thorough documentation, and validation of requirements with all stakeholders.
